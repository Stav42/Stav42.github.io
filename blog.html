                I have been meaning to do this for a very long time. To set the context, this is going to be a 3 hour read on battery technology (at a minimum!). It will be fairly rigorous. I hope to cover it till a point where the 
                professionals might start finding it useful. For me, it serves as a starting point to find something to dedicate my working hours to.

                    I'll start with some interesting checkpoints in history. The earliest evidence of something akin to battery is the Parthian Battery which is around 2000 years old and traced to the 
                    Parthian empire. It is a clay jar with vinegar solution (electrolyte) into which an iron rod surrounded by copper cylinder was inserted (electrodes!). It gave off a voltage of 1.1 to 2V.
                    Now while there are disputes about the purpose of this device (some think it was a battery, and others think it was some kind of electroplating) it still serves as a 
                    nice note that experiments with potentials were in works since long ago.
