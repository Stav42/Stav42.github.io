                I have been meaning to do this for a very long time. To set the context, this is going to be a 3 hour read on battery technology (at a minimum!). It will be fairly rigorous. I hope to cover it till a point where the 
                professionals might start finding it useful. For me, it serves as a starting point to find something to dedicate my working hours to.

                    I'll start with some interesting checkpoints in history. The earliest evidence of something akin to battery is the Parthian Battery which is around 2000 years old and traced to the 
                    Parthian empire. It is a clay jar with vinegar solution (electrolyte) into which an iron rod surrounded by copper cylinder was inserted (electrodes!). It gave off a voltage of 1.1 to 2V.
                    Now while there are disputes about the purpose of this device (some think it was a battery, and others think it was some kind of electroplating) it still serves as a 
                    nice note that experiments with potentials were in works since long ago.
                    <br><br>
                    Alessandro Volta discovered in 1800 that certain fluids generate a continuous flow of electrical current which led to the development of the first voltaic cell. He eventually
                    also demonstrated a use for this phenomena through something he called 'an electrical pistol'. The set up included a long-distance communication wire with the other end in a jar of methane. When
                    the electical spark was sent through, it made the jar burst. Single bit of information transfer. <i>On</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1859 came the first rechargeable battery courtesy Mr. Gaston Plante using lead acid. In 1899, Waldemar Junger developed the Nickel-Cadmium battery (NiCd). Two years later, Edison replaced the 
                    cadmium with Iron, giving birth to the NiFe battery. These legacy batteries have lost their relevance over the years. NiCd is harmful to the environment, and EU even necessitated replacememt of NiCd with 
                    NiMH. <br><br>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    With the history out of the way, its time to dive into the technical aspects of battery. I want to establish a few standard terminologies to make sure we are on the same page. I won't digress too much. Only two terminologies (right now).
                    <br><br>

                    <i><strong>Specific Energy</strong></i>: Capacity of the battery in Wh/Kg. Its kind of how long the battery can sustain some load (as in how long it can keep supplying current). Higher specific energy, longer time to discharge.
                    <br><i><strong>Specific Power</strong></i>: This is related to the maximum current a battery can provide at any instant. Unit is W/kg. It relates more to the high-current load requirement than anything else. 
                    <br><br>
                    Essentially, a battery is stored energy. In a battery, there are four components: a cathode, an anode, a seperator, and an electrolyte. 
                    <br><br>
                    What does a battery generally look like, in its simplest form? Imagine a container, with copper plate at one side and zinc strips at the other. The container is filled with an electrolyte, which in this case is a sodium chloride salt solution (common salt dissolved in water).
                    An <strong>electrolyte</strong> is a substance which conducts electricity when dissolved into water. The details of the conduction mechanism is interesting in itself, but we will ignore it for the while. 
                    Connect a bulb, with the positive terminal of it attached to the copper plate, and the negative terminal at zinc. Now when the connections are established the bulb lights up. 
                    <br><br>
                    In this case, when the connections are established, chemical reactions take place at both ends. Since zinc is more reactive than copper, it starts to oxidate i.e. the following reaction occurs:
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: center;" class="paragraph">At Zinc (anode)</p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2e^-;
                    \end{align}
                    $$ 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;" class="paragraph">At Copper (cathode)</p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Cu + 2e^-;
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    
                    I'll give a hint of how this happens later. Right now, it is important to see that when the decomposition happens at the zinc (which is why it is called the anode. Anode, by definition, is the electrode from which electrons leave when discharging.) The electrons that are ejected 
                    move through the external circuit to the cathode (copper) where they combine with \(Cu^{2+}\) to form normal solid Copper. 
                    <br><br>This is important because when the electrons move through the external circuit, we call it electricity. To summarize:
                    <br>
                    <ul class="paragraph">
                        <li><strong>Anode</strong>: This is where oxidation occurs. Oxidation is the removal of electrons. So, anode is the electrode which loses electrons.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cathode</strong>: This is where reduction occurs. Reduction is the addition of electrons. So cathode is the electrode where electrons are absorbed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Electrolyte</strong>: Facilitates the movement of ions. These ions are not the ions produced by electron transfer in electrode. In our case, these are \(Na^+\) and \(Cl^-\).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Finally, there is the <i><strong>seperator</strong></i> whose job is to ensure that the electrodes don't make contact i.e. do not short. If that happens, a lot of current will flow through. Fire, burns, you get the idea. So the seperator is also very important.
                    <br><br>
                    To get a sense of why reaction happens the way it does, it's is prudent to get a look at the famous electrode potential table. Following is a table that lists the relative <i>reactivity</i> of the electrodes in a sense.
                </p>
                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <img style="height: 450px;" src="resources/Electrode_potential.jpeg" alt="Standard Reduction Potential">
                    <figcaption style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Standard Electrode Potential for many materials</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In the table above, the <strong><i>reduction</i> potential</strong> refers to the tendency of the compounds/electrons to gain an electron. If you reverse the reactions and flip the sign of the numbers, you'll get the tendency of each of them to <i>oxidize</i> i.e. lose an electron.
                    As you can see in the table, copper (Cu) has a higher tendency to get reduced than zinc (Zn), and therefore it is the one that gains electrons in the simple battery that we have. In our case, the copper electrode is therefore the cathode as it gains electrons.<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Since the electrons always move from a lower potential to a higher potential, we can say that copper is at the higher potential in this reaction. Hence, it will be called the <strong>positive electrode</strong>. Consequently, zinc electrode will be called the <strong>negative electrode</strong>. 
                    Now, depending on the direction of the reaction (when charging, this reaction reverses), the anode and cathode may change but the positive and negative electrode will stay the same physical entity. 
                    <br><br>
                    At this point, it probably is going to be useful to start talking about the popular types of battery in use in the world today. <strong>Lead Acid Battery</strong> is a good place to start, since it is a battery that is still in great use, and has seen multiple evolutions. We will probe the 
                    capabilities, construction, issues and the chemistry behind it. In this process, I suspect we will learn a lot about materials, alloys and chemistry.

                    Lead acid batteries[2] is the first battery to be recyclable. It was discovered in 1859 by Gaston Planté. In a simple lead acid battery, there are three components:
                    <ul class="paragraph">
                        <li>Positive Plate: Lead Dioxide \(PbO_2\)</li>

                    The chemistry during discharge between these three components looks like:

                            In both reactions, at the end the solid \(PbSO_4(s)\) is formed. The complete reaction during discharge hence looks like: 
                            $$
                            \begin{align}

                            In this complete reaction, \(PbSO_4\) is precipitated at both the plates[5]. The reaction during discharge happens through <strong>precipitation dissipation</strong> <button type="button" class="pop_arrow" id="precdiss"></button> reaction where a super-saturated \(Pb^{2+}\) solution is first formed through charge transfer reaction on \(Pb \) and \( \beta\text{-}PbO_2\) followed by precipitation of \(PbSO_4\) on both plates. The
                             particle size of \(PbSO_4\) formation depends on the concentration of \(Pb^{2+}\) ions. The concentration of \(Pb^{2+}\) is therefore an important factor in the discharge reaction, which in turn is controlled by the concentration of sulfuric acid solution and the current density of discharge.

                            <strong>Solubility Product</strong>
                            <hr>
                                The solubility of a substance in any liquid medium can range from completely soluble (miscible) to completely insoluble (immiscible). A substance which is only partially soluble, would precipitate if we add more substance
                                in the medium than it can take. This means that for substances that are not completely miscible, there is a limit to the weight of it we can add to the medium and expect it to disappear completely
                                in the solution. If we add more, it will start to settle in the container as solid. It won't dissolve any longer. 
                                <br><br>
                                While this makes sense, the really interesting part in realizing that the situation is not a static one. In fact it is very dynamic. The solid form of the substance and the dissolved components are actually in dynamic equilibrium throughout. Such a reaction is called a <strong>precipitation dissipation</strong> reaction.
                                <br><br>
                                Take the example of Silver Chloride:
                                $$
                                \operatorname{AgCl}(s) \underset{\text { precipitation }}{\stackrel{\text { dissolution }}{\rightleftarrows}} \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q)
                                $$
                             In this situation, at any point some part of the solid breaks and goes into the solution and some ions that are already present in the solution combinse, solidify and precipitate. Now, though the amount of solid in this saturated solution is 
                             constant, the particles are not static. It's not the case that the elements in solid stay in the solid. This exchange keeps happening. This is called <strong>dynamic equilibrium</strong>.
                             <br><br>
                             One can also calculate the concentration of ions in the solution in a solution at equilibrium. This can be done through the concept of <strong>Solublity Product</strong> denoted usually as \(K_{sp}\)             
                             <br><br>
                             At equilibrium, \(K_{sp} = [Ag^+(aq)][Cl^-(aq)]\). The square elements are the values of the concentration of \(Ag^+\) and \(Cl^-\) in units of Molarity (which is number of moles of a substance in a litre of solution. A mole is a certain number of entities. We'll discuss all this later.)
                             <br>The value of \(K_{sp}\) is fixed at a given temperature. So from the formula, one can get the exact concentration of the ions in the solution. To study solubility product further, [6] is a nice reference.

                            During charging, \(Pb^{2+}\) ions on both plates are supplied by \(PbSO_4\) crystals. Because \(PbSO_4\) is a non-conducting ionic solid, the oxidation of \(PbSO_4\) to \(\beta\text{-}PbO_2\) and the reduction to \(Pb\) during charge happens at the interface between \(PbSO_4\) crystal and \(\beta\text{-}PbO_2\) or \(Pb\) on the grid alloy which is a conductor. Hence, current density, crystal size and solubility of \(PbSO_4\) in sulfuric acid solution, diffusion coefficient and diffusion path of 
                            \(Pb^{2+}\) ions play an important role in affecting the charge performance. <button type="button" class="pop_arrow" id="diffusion"></button>

                                <strong>Diffusion coefficient</strong>: The diffusion coefficient, typically denoted as \(D\), is a measure of the rate at which particles (like ions) diffuse, or spread out, through a medium. It quantifies how fast the particles are moving due to thermal energy. It depends on factors like temperature, the medium through which the ions are moving, and the size and charge of the ions. Generally, 
                                \(D\) increases with temperature due to increased atomic or molecular motion. This relationship is often described by the Arrhenius equation: \(D = D_0e^{-E_a/{RT}}\) <br>

                            Lead sponge is a structure composed of a lot of lead strands connected to each other. It is extremely porous and is 75-90% empty space by volume. It has an extremely high surface area that might result in it being a more 
                            efficient negative plate. There is an excellent youtube video by NileRed who demonstrates such a structure. The one he produces is not exactly lead sponge, rather its a composite of lead and zinc with the structure held by lead strands coming out of zinc powder. No matter, its only for illustration.

                            Its also worth going into the construction and manufacturing of components of lead acid battery. There are two electrodes with spongy lead on one and lead dioxide on the other, and their structural integrity is maintained through grids made of lead alloy at both side. The active material is pasted on the grid in a manner illustrated in the figure 3. The positive 
                            grid plate is coated with lead dioxide and the negative grid plate is coated with spongy lead. The lead grid also acts a conductor for the entire process. <br><br>

                            Earlier, pure lead had been in use till its poor structural integrity necessitated replacement with lead alloy. The first alloy to be used was lead-antimony (8-12%). This antimony-heavy alloy had some issues, the main being the evolution of excessive
                            volumes of hydrogen in the process. As a result, they were replaced with lead-calcium and lead-selenium grid alloys. Antimony was still used but in lesser percentages. <br><br>These new alloys give more strength to the grid, allowing it to carry more active material which meant a battery with higher capacity. Adding antimony and tin also improves deep cycling.  <button type="button" class="pop_arrow" id="deep_cycling"></button>
                            The coating on the plates is done with a paste of lead oxide, sulfuric acid and water. This is followed by curing where the plates are heated in high-humidity environment. The curing changes the paste into lead sulphate and evaporates the water.

                                Deep cycling refers to charging a battery, discharging it completely and repeating this cycle. When you completely discharge a battery, and do this quite often, it is bad for its health. In the case of lead acid battery,

                            Modern day coating contains carbon black, blanc fixe and lignosulfate[2] <button type="button" class="pop_arrow" id="lignosulfonate"></button>. The blanc fixe (barium sulphate) acts as a seed crystal (Q - how) for lead-to-lead sulphate reaction, where lead sulphate crystals are to be formed. The lignosulfate ensures that the crystal formation is dendritic in nature (i.e. it grows in needle form, and irregularly shaped). Look at Figure 5.
                            The dendritic form ensures greater surface area for the crystal which eases reverse reaction while charging.<br><br>

                            Carbon black ensures that the lignosulfonate doesn't inhibit the reaction, and kind of behaves as a conducting agent. Presently, Sulfonated naphthalene condensate also is used instaed of lignosulfonate nad has better properties.

                            Lignosulfates - a digression
                            <hr>
                            Lignosulfonates are sulfonate derivate of lignin. This means that a lignosulfonate molecule is just a lignin molecule with some part removed and a sulfonate group \(HSO_3^-\) added instead. Lignin is a polymer of aromatic compounds, primarily phenylpropanoids, which means that it is a structure composed of a number of phenylpropanoid molecules linked to each other through some bonds. Lignin is the third most abundant organic
                            compound after chitin and cellulose. 
                            In nature, lignin is primarily present in plants to provide structural support to the cell walls of plant tissues. Lignin also assists in water transport within plants. 
                            One of the functional properties of lignosulfonates is as a crystal growth modifier. The surface active properties of lignosulfonates cause interactions with the surface of growing crystals.
