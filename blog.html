                I have been meaning to do this for a very long time. To set the context, this is going to be a 3 hour read on battery technology (at a minimum!). It will be fairly rigorous. I hope to cover it till a point where the 
                professionals might start finding it useful. For me, it serves as a starting point to find something to dedicate my working hours to.

                    I'll start with some interesting checkpoints in history. The earliest evidence of something akin to battery is the Parthian Battery which is around 2000 years old and traced to the 
                    Parthian empire. It is a clay jar with vinegar solution (electrolyte) into which an iron rod surrounded by copper cylinder was inserted (electrodes!). It gave off a voltage of 1.1 to 2V.
                    Now while there are disputes about the purpose of this device (some think it was a battery, and others think it was some kind of electroplating) it still serves as a 
                    nice note that experiments with potentials were in works since long ago.
                    <br><br>
                    Alessandro Volta discovered in 1800 that certain fluids generate a continuous flow of electrical current which led to the development of the first voltaic cell. He eventually
                    also demonstrated a use for this phenomena through something he called 'an electrical pistol'. The set up included a long-distance communication wire with the other end in a jar of methane. When
                    the electical spark was sent through, it made the jar burst. Single bit of information transfer. <i>On</i>.

                    In 1859 came the first rechargeable battery courtesy Mr. Gaston Plante using lead acid. In 1899, Waldemar Junger developed the Nickel-Cadmium battery (NiCd). Two years later, Edison replaced the 
                    cadmium with Iron, giving birth to the NiFe battery. These legacy batteries have lost their relevance over the years. NiCd is harmful to the environment, and EU even necessitated replacememt of NiCd with 
                    NiMH. <br><br>

                    With the history out of the way, its time to dive into the technical aspects of battery. I want to establish a few standard terminologies to make sure we are on the same page. I won't digress too much. Only two terminologies (right now).
                    <br><br>

                    <i><strong>Specific Energy</strong></i>: Capacity of the battery in Wh/Kg. Its kind of how long the battery can sustain some load (as in how long it can keep supplying current). Higher specific energy, longer time to discharge.
                    <br><i><strong>Specific Power</strong></i>: This is related to the maximum current a battery can provide at any instant. Unit is W/kg. It relates more to the high-current load requirement than anything else. 
                    <br><br>
                    Essentially, a battery is stored energy. In a battery, there are three components: a cathode, an anode, and an electrolyte. Cathode and anode are metal electrodes. When charging takes place, electrons move from the negative terminal
                    of the charger and collect at the anode. This results in build-up of electrons at the anode. The ions in the electrolyte arrange themselves accordingly. As the electrons come to the anode, some chemical reactions start to take place. How, I'll explain later!
                    When the electrons reach the anode, the anode material gains these electrons. This process is known as reduction. So in case of lithium ion batteries, these Li+ ions get reduced to Li. These new chemical bonds (of Li) are essentially where the energy is being stored,
                    <br><br>
                    Now during discharge, the entire set up (choice of electrodes, and electrolyte) is such that it makes it energetically favourable for the system to lose electrons back at the anode (this is oxidation; losing electrons). So the electrons are lost, and this movement of charged particles
                    allow current when circuit is complete. Sometimes, an anode is defined in a self-fulfilling manner. An anode is the electrode where the electrons leave when discharge is happening.
