                I have been meaning to do this for a very long time. To set the context, this is going to be a 3 hour read on battery technology (at a minimum!). It will be fairly rigorous. I hope to cover it till a point where the 
                professionals might start finding it useful. For me, it serves as a starting point to find something to dedicate my working hours to.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    I'll start with some interesting checkpoints in history. The earliest evidence of something akin to battery is the Parthian Battery which is around 2000 years old and traced to the 
                    Parthian empire. It is a clay jar with vinegar solution (electrolyte) into which an iron rod surrounded by copper cylinder was inserted (electrodes!). It gave off a voltage of 1.1 to 2V.
                    Now while there are disputes about the purpose of this device (some think it was a battery, and others think it was some kind of electroplating) it still serves as a 
                    nice note that experiments with potentials were in works since long ago.
                    <br><br>
                    Alessandro Volta discovered in 1800 that certain fluids generate a continuous flow of electrical current which led to the development of the first voltaic cell. He eventually
                    also demonstrated a use for this phenomena through something he called 'an electrical pistol'. The set up included a long-distance communication wire with the other end in a jar of methane. When
                    the electical spark was sent through, it made the jar burst. Single bit of information transfer. <i>On</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1859 came the first rechargeable battery courtesy Mr. Gaston Plante using lead acid. In 1899, Waldemar Junger developed the Nickel-Cadmium battery (NiCd). Two years later, Edison replaced the 
                    cadmium with Iron, giving birth to the NiFe battery. These legacy batteries have lost their relevance over the years. NiCd is harmful to the environment, and EU even necessitated replacememt of NiCd with 
                    NiMH. <br><br>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    With the history out of the way, its time to dive into the technical aspects of battery. I want to establish a few standard terminologies to make sure we are on the same page. I won't digress too much. Only two terminologies (right now).
                    <br><br>

                    <i><strong>Specific Energy</strong></i>: Capacity of the battery in Wh/Kg. Its kind of how long the battery can sustain some load (as in how long it can keep supplying current). Higher specific energy, longer time to discharge.
                    <br><i><strong>Specific Power</strong></i>: This is related to the maximum current a battery can provide at any instant. Unit is W/kg. It relates more to the high-current load requirement than anything else. 
                    <br><br>
                    Essentially, a battery is stored energy. In a battery, there are four components: a cathode, an anode, a seperator, and an electrolyte. 
                    <br><br>
                    Let me give a general setting of a battery cell. Imagine a container, with copper plate at one side and zinc strips at the other. The container is filled with an electrolyte, which in this case is a sodium chloride salt solution (common salt dissolved in water).
                    Connect a bulb, with the positive terminal of it attached to the copper plate, and the negative terminal at zinc. Now when the connections are established the bulb lights up. What happened and why?
                    <br><br>
                    In this case, when the connections are established, chemical reactions take place at both ends. Since zinc is more reactive than copper, it starts to oxidate i.e. the following reaction occurs:
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: center;" class="paragraph">At Zinc (anode)</p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2e^-;
                    \end{align}
                    $$ 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;" class="paragraph">At Copper (cathode)</p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Cu + 2e^-;
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    
                    Why this happens and not the other way round is slightly more theoretical, which we'll definitely get into but not now. Now, when the decomposition happens at the zinc (which is why it is called the anode. Anode, by definition, is the electrode from which electrons leave when discharging.) The electrons that are ejected 
                    move through the external circuit to the cathode (copper) where they combine with \(Cu^{2+}\) to form good ol' normal Copper. 
                    <br><br>This is important because when the electrons move through the external circuit, that is exactly what is known as electricity. To summarize:
                    <br>
                    <ul class="paragraph">
                        <li>Anode: Electrode where the electrons are freed</li>
                        <li>Cathode: Electrode where electrodes are absorbed</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Of course, in the above reactions, ions are also decomposed. Over time during discharge, the concentration of \(Zn^{2+}\) increases and the concentration of \(Cu^{2+}\) decreases. Meanwhile, cathode is negatively charged due to the influx of electrons and the anode is positively charged. The ions in the electrolyte get attracted to each oppositely charged electrode (not necessarily the Zinc and copper ions. Ions of the electrolyte primarily are involved in this movement). 
                    <ul class="paragraph">
                        <li>Electrolyte: Facilitates the movement of ions. The electrons move only through the external circuit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Finally, there is the <i>seperator</i> whose job is to ensure that the electrodes don't make contact i.e. do not short. If that happens, a lot of current will flow through. Fire, burns, you get the idea. So the seperator is also very important.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    At this point, it probably is going to be useful to start talking about the popular types of battery in use in the world today. Lead Acid battery, a thoroughly dependable rechargable battery is a good place to start. We'll explore its chemistry and 
                    engineering in great depth.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Lead acid batteries is the first battery to be recyclable. It was discovered in 1859 by Gaston Plant√©. In a simple lead acid battery, there are three components:
                    <ul class="paragraph">
                        <li>Positive Plate: Lead Dioxide \(PbO_2\)</li>
                        <li>Negative Plate: Spongy Lead \(Pb\)</li>
                        <li>Electrolye: Diluted Sulfuric Acid \(H_2SO_4\)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The chemistry during discharge between these three components looks like:

                            Because the electrons leave at the negative plate, the lead dioxide gets a negative charge. In both reactions, at the end the solid \(PbSO_4(s)\) is formed. After being completely discharged the entire composition looks like Figure 2. As a natural curiosity, lets analyze what spongy lead looks like. 
                            <br><br>
                            Lead sponge is a structure composed of a lot of lead strands connected to each other. It is extremely porous and is 75-90% empty space by volume. It has an extremely high surface area that might result in it being a more 
                            efficient negative plate. There is an excellent youtube video by NileRed who demonstrates such a structure. The one he produces is not exactly lead sponge, rather its a composite of lead and zinc with the structure held by lead strands coming out of zinc powder. No matter, its only for illustration. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Its also worth going into the construction and manufacturing of components of lead acid battery. There are two electrodes with spongy lead on one and lead dioxide on the other, and their structural integrity is maintained through grids made of lead alloy at both side. The active material is pasted on the grid in a manner illustrated in the figure 3. The positive 
                            grid plate is coated with lead dioxide and the negative grid plate is coated with spongy lead. The lead grid also acts a conductor for the entire process. <br><br>

                            Earlier, pure lead had been in use till its poor structural integrity necessitated replacement with lead alloy. The first alloy to be used was lead-antimony (8-12%). This antimony-heavy alloy had some issues, the main being the evolution of excessive
                            volumes of hydrogen in the process. As a result, they were replaced with lead-calcium and lead-selenium grid alloys. Antimony was still used but in lesser percentages. These new alloys give more strength to the grid, allowing it to carry more active material which meant a battery with higher capacity. 
                            <br>
                            The coating on the plates is done with a paste of lead oxide, sulfuric acid and water. This is followed by curing where the plates are heated in high-humidity environment. The curing changes the paste into lead sulphate and evaporates the water.
