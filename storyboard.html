                    This is a journey through my first application that I am trying to make. This post is an effort to actually force me to finish this work. Since it's in the public, along with the fact that I intend to share my website
                    to multiple people, I expect to finish the work so that I don't embarrass myself. This is my first <i>creation</i>, and I hope to make many more creations. It's the only way forward.

                        I'll briefly summarize the idea, and then describe my plan for the various components that I think will be involved in the field. I shall also log these entries on their dates, so 
                        that I may see the improvements in my ideation (or the detriment!). <br><br>

                            The StoryBoard is an application that is borne out of my need for effective study. I haven't yet encountered any platform where one might interact with multiple data sources simultaneously to create a meaningful 
                            synthesis out of all those, along with references. It's essentially a research tool. I wanted to be able to have multiple sources open simultaneously, pick some stuff from some source, another stuff from another source and
                             put them together to create a story that serves my purpose. The <i>USP</i> of the app is going to have two components:
                             <ul class="paragraph">
                                <li><b>User Interface</b>: I have an idea for the interface and it is going to be neat. The interface is extremely important and needs to be super intuitive for this application to stick</li>
                                <li><b>Effective Search</b>: A research tool must have strong search. It's quite obvious. While the above is fairly straightforward to implement, this component is slightly more, shall I say, prone to real world 
                                    complexities. Copyrights, rate limits, and quality search.</li>
                             </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Now, I will expand on the above ideas a bit more in my later logs. I wanted to give visual cues as well about my ideas, but sadly I don't have anything like that ready as of now. But I promise, I shall keep you updated as the 
                            app progresses. There are some other application ideas that I shall be exploring in some other project ideas. <i>Stay Tuned</i>
